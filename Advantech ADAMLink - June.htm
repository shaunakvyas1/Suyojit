              <br>
              </font></b>Recently a customer asked what the difference is between 
              2-wire and 4-wire serial RS-485 communication. To answer this question 
              it is helpful to have some understanding of the RS-485 standard. 
              The problem is that "RS" stands for "Recommended 
              Standard" and has not been treated by manufacturers as an absolute 
              definition. The RS-485 standard was established by Electronic Industries 
              Alliance, EIA, in 1983 as a half duplex multi-drop variation of 
              the balanced or differential simplex signal standard, RS-422. Current 
              standards for serial communication are typically established by 
              the EIA and the Telecommunications Industry Association, TIA. The 
              current standard for RS-485 was set in 1998 and is designated TIA/EIA-485-A. 
              For many years, manufacturers have loosely employed what is commonly 
              called RS-485 to provide reliable multi-drop serial communication 
              for their specific and sometimes proprietary network. However, these 
              RS-485 variations are what make common compatibility between some 
              manufacturers virtually impossible. 4-wire implementation of RS-485 
              is one of these variations.</font></font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To gain a more 
              detailed understanding of the difference between 2-wire and 4-wire 
              RS-485, a layman's understanding of the basic concept of this standard 
              may be helpful. One of the most important things to understand about 
              the common communication standards such as RS-232, RS-422, and RS-485, 
              is that they are strictly hardware standards and do not define any 
              characteristics of the data. These standards describe some electrical 
              characteristics of the media, that is the wire through which the 
              signal passes, and some electrical characteristics of the transmitters 
              and receivers which define how many of each can be connected together 
              and things like the voltage levels of the signal. The terms "balanced" 
              or "differential" signal is used to characterize RS-422 
              and RS-485 serial communication. For the purpose of this discussion 
              these terms may be used interchangeably. It is the main difference 
              between the single-ended RS-232 signal and the differential RS-422 
              and RS-485 signal. Because RS-232 is single-ended, that is, the 
              signal references a common signal ground, and that ground is easily 
              distorted by external noise, RS-232 is reliable only for short distances. 
              RS-422 and RS-485 use a differential signal which is an opposing 
              positive and negative signal, each on its own wire, so that when 
              the positive goes high, above ground reference, the negative does 
              the same going low, below ground reference. Thus two signals are 
              compared to each other and not with the ground reference making 
              them much more resistant to noise. Noise typically introduced from 
              the environment impacts the negative and positive signal equally, 
              but the comparison of the signals is usually not affected significantly. 
              RS-422 and RS-485 also use twisted pair wires to carry the positive 
              and negative signals so that the fields surrounding the conductors 
              created by these opposing signals complement each other, and in 
              effect, reinforce the signal. The differential signal and the twisted 
              pair media are the two primary reasons RS-422 and RS-485 signals 
              are much more resistant to environmental electromagnetic noise than 
              RS-232, and subsequently can support transmission distances up to 
              100 times greater.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RS-232 was the 
              most common type of serial communication port found on consumer 
              computers. USB and Ethernet are rapidly displacing RS-232 in the 
              consumer market but RS-422 and RS-485 are still popular in the industrial 
              market where the environment might demand greater serial communication 
              distances in higher levels of electromagnetic interference. RS-422 
              with a differential signal was designed to be a more reliable version 
              of the single-ended RS-232 signal. In typical applications both 
              RS-232 and RS-422 are peer-to-peer. This means that the transmitter 
              of one device is wired to the receiver of the other device and vice 
              versa. In the case of RS-232 this requires one wire for transmission, 
              one wire for reception, and one wire for the signal ground. RS-422 
              use twisted pairs instead of a single wire for each signal, so two 
              wires for transmission and two wires for reception, or a 4-wire 
              system.<br>
              <br>
              The next step came with the realization that connection of multiple 
              devices on a single communication link could offer significant savings 
              both in cable and hardware interface cost. RS-422 allows for up 
              to ten receivers to be connected to a single transmitter. But this 
              means that one device would be master and all other devices would 
              be slaves without the capability to respond. This is called simplex 
              communication when data flows in only one direction on a wire or 
              twisted pair. Keep in mind that a twisted pair does not carry two 
              different signals; it is the same signal with opposing polarities. 
              So RS-232 and RS-422 are simplex. Data flows over one wire or twisted 
              pair in only one direction. For a device to communicate data over 
              RS-232 or RS-422 it must have both a transmitter and a receiver 
              with a separate wire or twisted pair connected to both. The bi-directional 
              communication may take place, but over the individual wires the 
              communication is simplex. The only logical way to make a multi-drop 
              serial communication network that would not require many transmitters 
              and receivers in each device, not to mention the many individual 
              wires to interconnect them, would be to design a transmitter-receiver 
              that could share a single wire or twisted pair. This is RS-485, 
              an electrical definition of components that would allow bi-directional 
              communication on a single twisted pair giving it the signal integrity 
              of RS-422. But unlike simplex communication where data only flows 
              in one direction because a transmitter is on one end and one or 
              more receivers is on the other end, all connections have transmitters 
              and receivers and data can flow in any direction. But electrically 
              RS-485 is not designed to allow data to flow in both directions 
              at the same time, which is called full duplex, but requires data 
              sequenced to only flow in one direction at a time, called half duplex.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bi-directional 
              half duplex communication among multiple stations on a single twisted 
              pair also creates a logical problem in sequencing data flow. Unlike 
              RS-422 simplex systems which have only one transmitter on a twisted 
              pair so that it is not possible for two transmitters to talk on 
              the same twisted pair at the same time; with RS-485 this collision 
              can occur. So data flow control becomes an important part of RS-485, 
              although it is not part of the standard. It becomes the responsibility 
              of the developer of the data communication protocol used over RS-485 
              to build a scheme for this type of collision prevention. The easiest 
              way to do this is to do the same thing that is done in RS-422, allow 
              one master and all other stations to be slaves. In this case the 
              master always initiates communication by interrogating only one 
              other station. Then the slave may transmit a response to the master 
              and no other stations transmit. This is bi-directional because the 
              master and the slave both transmit and receive on the same twisted 
              pair, so that sequentially, data flows in both directions, but not 
              at the same time. It is half-duplex because data flows in only one 
              direction at a time, not simultaneously in both directions. This 
              is the way a typical 2-wire RS-485 application works. All of Advantech's 
              RS-485 based ADAM modules use this common 2-wire scheme.</font></p>
